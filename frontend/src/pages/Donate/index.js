          Planning for the Harvest 4th of July Extravaganza is in full swing! This event will take place on Saturday, June 30th. Activities will include*: a parade, shaved ice truck, various children's activities, cornhole tournament, inflatable obstacle course, hot dog lunch, kegs, potluck dinner, photo booth, live band, a spectacular firework show, and more. It will be an event you and your family wonâ€™t want to miss! (*funds permitting)

          Because this is such a grand event, we are asking for donations from each household to fund this action-packed day. We are requesting a minimum donation of $25 for a group of 2, $50 for a group of 4, and $100 for a group of 8. Every donation is appreciated!
        </p>

          We are looking for additional support through sponsors (donations of $150 or more) and gifts that will be utilized at our giveaway. Contact us on the contact page for more details. This year has a tier reward system for sponsors with many great incentives!
